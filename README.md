## Autor Note

This program has been developed by: Alberto Melchor Herrera, melchorherrera@gmail.com. I am greateful to those people that have developed software in which I got inspiration. This version of the software is free to use and modify. I am available at the email for support or any other issues.


## About

It implements an e-commerce system. Ajax and WYSIWYG. It is written in PHP (As well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript). It uses Mysql for a database.


## Installation

1. Upload the files to your web server.
2. Unpack it to the destination folder.
3. Create a database and import file includes/database.sql. You can use PhpMyAdmin for this purpose.
4. Edit database settings at: includes/config.sample.php and rename it to config.php.
5. Give write permisions to the folder catalog/images/small (To allow upload product images).
6. For further database control install the complement [DbManager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freshhh-dbmanager/).

## Getting started

Open the browser (chrome or firefox) at the main folder URL. The ecommerce system will appear.

There are two already created users: "webadmin" and "ordersadmin". These are the users names, and users passwords are the same as users names.

User "ordersadmin" is order administrator and can watch and edit all the orders. Once you log in with this user click at "Show orders" button.

User "webadmin" is web administrator user and can edit the web page content and the catalog (categories and items).

Once editing some content press Intro or click outside from the editable area to save changes.

For system configuration edit file javascript/config.js
