## Autor Note

This program has been developed by: Alberto Melchor Herrera, melchorherrera@gmail.com. I am greateful to those people that have developed software in which I got inspiration. This version of the software is free to use and modify.

## About

This software implements an ORM system for developing web applications. It comes with simmple example of a booking system so you can get more info about its functionalities. It is written in PHP (As well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript). It uses Mysql for a database. You could find documentation at the project https://sourceforge.net/projects/youronlineshop/ that is using this system.

## Installation

1. Upload the files to your web server.
2. Unpack it to the destination folder.
3. Create a database and import file example/database.sql. You can use PhpMyAdmin for this purpose.
4. Edit database settings at: core/includes/config.sample.php and rename it to config.php.

## Getting started

Open the browser (chrome or firefox) at the main folder url you will see a page with the booking. This is an example of an hotel booking system. It has no functionalities except the one page you see at init. You can look at index.html and the template files to get an idea of how it works. For furder information come to the project https://sourceforge.net/projects/youronlineshop/.
